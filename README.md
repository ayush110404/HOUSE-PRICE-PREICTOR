# PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> DevTown
</b>.
<br><b>The AIM of the project was to predict the price price of house in a locality based on 14 index
like crime rate and locality around it.</b></br>
The data set we are using is from kaggle's boston house prices
